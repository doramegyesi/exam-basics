# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
The constructor is usually the first, special method of a class.
Looks like this:
def __init__()
Python will automatically call it when a new instance is made within that class.
So when I create a new instance, it is going to inherit whatever I write in the argument
of the constructor.
