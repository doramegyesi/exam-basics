# Create a function called `odd_average` that takes a list of numbers as parameter
# and returns the average value of the odd numbers in the list
# Create basic unit tests for it with at least 3 different test cases

    #needs a for loop
    #choose odd numbers
    #return sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
